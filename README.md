# PHP Akismet client
If you've been looking for a client, you've probably seen some that are made for PHP4, and use `fsockopen`. Not really that great, so I decided to make a modern client that uses Guzzle.

## Project's status
~~Still under active development, working on getting 2 more endpoints integrated.~~ No time, sorry :(
